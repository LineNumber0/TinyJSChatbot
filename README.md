# TinyJSChatbot
A start up of a Chatbot using JavaScript.

Hello World !
This is a tiny JavaScript dialog, my goal is to make it looks like a real chat app using only front-end languages (HTML, CSS and JavaScript)
For a demonstration when prompt() function asks your name click CANCEL or OK.


for educational purpose and fun !
Thanks ! and happy coding !
